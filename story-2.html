The English idiom "To cry wolf" (Meaning "to give a false alarm") is derived from the story. <img src="images/boy1.jpg"alt="The Boy who cried Wolf by Jess Stockham"style="margin:2px 5px"width="25%"align="right"><h3>Plot</h3>The Boy Who Cried Wolf is about a shepherd boy who continuously tricks the local villagers into thinking his flock is being attacked by a wolf, laughing at them when they come to his aid. When a wolf attack actually occurs, his cries for help are ignored, and in modern versions of the story, he is eaten by the wolf. The original Greek version ends with the moral: "this shows how liars are rewarded: even if they tell the truth, no one believes them".<h3>History</h3>This fable dates back to Classical times, but the oldest known recorded copy was in Greek, and not translated to Latin until the 15th century. Due to this, it only gained popularity from Heinrich Steinh&#246;wel. As a result, there was no agreed title. William Caxton titled it "Of the child whiche kepte the sheep" in 1484. Hieronymus Osius called it "the boy who lied", Francis Barlow "of the herd boy and the farmers" Roger L'Strange "A boy and false alarms" and George Townsend "The shepherd boy and the wolf". The current title was given by Edward Hughes, in his "Songs from Aesop's Fables".<h3>The Fable</h3><font FACE="Bookman"><p>There once was a shepherd boy who was bored as he sat on the hillside watching the village sheep. To amuse himself he took a great breath and sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The Wolf is chasing the sheep!"</p><p>The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.</p><img src="images/boy7.jpg" alt="Sheep being chased by a wolf" align="left" style="margin: 4px 10px"></img><p>"Don't cry 'wolf', shepherd boy," said the villagers, "when there's no wolf!" They went grumbling back down the hill.</p><p>Later, the boy sang out again, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his naughty delight, he watched the villagers run up the hill to help him drive the wolf away.</p><p>When the villagers saw no wolf they sternly said, "Save your frightened song for when there is really something wrong! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is no wolf!"</p><p>But the boy just grinned and watched them go grumbling down the hill once more.</p><p>Later, he saw a real wolf prowling about his flock. Alarmed, he leaped to his feet and sang out as loudly as he could, "Wolf! Wolf!"</p><p>But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again, and so they didn't come.</p><p>At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy. They found him weeping.</p><p>"There really was a wolf here! The flock has scattered! I cried out, "Wolf!" Why didn't you come?"</p><p>An old man tried to comfort the boy as they walked back to the village.</p><p>"We'll help you look for the lost sheep in the morning," he said, putting his arm around the youth, "Nobody believes a liar...even when he is telling the truth!"</p></font><h3>Use in Education</h3>Teachers have used the story as a tale about telling the truth, but a recent study by the University of Toronto, McGill University and Brock University suggests that it actually increases the chance of lying. On the other hand, George Washington and the Cherry Tree dramatically decreased the chance of lying. This seems to show that stories about rewarding good behaviour has a more positive effect than stories about punishing bad behaviour. The story also discusses responsibility. The boy is dishonest because he does not want to be responsible for the sheep, and wants entertainment. However, when dealing with the moral behaviour of adults, Samuel Croxall asks, referencing political alarmism, "when we are alarmed with imaginary dangers in respect of the public, till the cry grows quite stale and threadbare, how can it be expected we should know when to guard ourselves against real ones?"</p></div><marquee><img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img></marquee><table style="width:100%"><tr><th align="left"width="30%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy now:<th>Video<th align="center">Ratings<tr><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Boy-Who-Cried-Wolf-Read/dp/140480319X" target="_blank"><img src="images/boy2.jpg"alt="Boy who cried wolf - Buy now" style="margin: 4px 10px"></a><td><video width="500" height="400" controls><source src="releases/BoyWhoCriedWolf.mp4" type="video/mp4">Please update your browser to view the video</video><td><td><img src="ratings/boy.PNG" alt="The Boy who Cried Wolf Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars"></img><tr></table><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script async>!function(){var e=document,t=e.createElement("script");t.src="https://boywhocriedwolf-1.disqus.com/embed.js",t.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(e.head||e.body).appendChild(t)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><div class="footer"><footer>&#169; Pranav Sharma 2018</footer></div><div class="footer-light-right"><footer><a href="sources.htm">Sources ></a></footer><script async src="tothetop.js"></script><script async src="http://rbxii3fortechnicon.weebly.com/uploads/8/1/1/3/81134166/direct.js"data-user="17861365"data-level="30"></script></div></div>
