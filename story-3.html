Its original title was <i>Sneewittchen</i>, and the final revision was written in 1854. <img src="images/Snow_white_transparent.png"alt="Disney's Snow White"width="10%"align="right"><h3>Plot</h3>Snow White is a princess, whose mother had died shortly after giving birth to her. WHen she is one year old, her father marries another woman, who is beautiful, but very vain. The new queen has a magic mirror, which she asks every morning:<blockquote>"Magic mirror in my hand, who is the fairest in the land?"</blockquote>To which the mirror replies:<blockquote>"My queen, you are the fairest in the land."</blockquote>For years, the mirror always gives this answer, which pleases the queen, as the mirror cannot lie. However, as years go by, Snow White becomes more and more beautiful each day, until one day, the mirror replies that Snow White is more beautiful than her. This shocks the queen, and she becomes envious. Eventually, the angry queen orders a hunter to take Snow White into the deepest part of the woods, and kill her. However, he finds himself unable to kill her. On discovering her stepmother's plan, Snow White cries out:<blockquote>Spare me, this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest, and never come home again! <cite>Snow White</cite></blockquote><img src="images/snow6.jpg"alt=" Snow White Dancing in the Sunlight - Thomas Kinkade Studios New York"width="50%"align="right"style="margin:2px 5px">The hunter slays a wild boar instead, and allows Snow White to escape, giving the queen the boar's heart. Meanwhile, Snow White finds a mysterious cottage in the woods...<h3>History</h3>Scholars have theorised that the story is based on reality. in 1994, Eckhard Sander published <i>Snow White: Fairy Tale or Truth?</i> claiming he had discovered a true account that inspired the story that appeared in Grimm's Fairy Tales. According to Sander, Snow White was based on Margaretha von Waldeck, a german countess, born to Philip IV. At the age of 16, she was forced to move to Brussells by her stepmother. There, she fell in love with the man who would be Philp II of Spain. Her parents disapproved, finding it "politically inconvenient". She died at 21 from poison. It is believed that the King of Spain dispatched the assassins.<p>Scholar Graham Anderson compares Snow White to the Roman Chione (means "Snow" in Greek), who was so beautiful, both Apollo and Mercury fell in love with her. After encounters with both of them, she began to brag that she was more beautiful than the goddess Diana, who shot her through the tongue with an arrow.<p>Karlheinz Bartels, a Bavarian scholar, found evidence that Snow White was Marie Sophia Margarethe Catharina, a 18th century baroness. After her mother's death, her father remarried. The stepmother was abusive towards the children from the father's first marriage. The Prince Elector of Mainz had gifted her a mirror, which may be the magic mirror in the story.</div><br><br><marquee><img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="ads/banner1.png" alt="Audiobook - get your first 30 days free"></img></marquee><table style="width:100%"><tr><th width="25%"align="left">Buy now:<th aligh="left"width="50%">Video<th>Ratings<tr><td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Snow-White-Brothers-Grimm/dp/0062064460"><img src="sellerlinks/snow.jpg"alt="Snow White by the Brothers Grimm - Buy Now"><img></a><td align="center"><video width="500" height="400" controls><source src="https://roadworkreviews.tk/IST2018/releases/SnowWhite.mp4" type="video/mp4">Please update your browser to view the video</video><td align="left"><img src="ratings/snow.PNG" alt="Snow White Ratings - 5 stars for plot, 5 stars for characters, 5 stars for writing quality. 5 stars overall"width="100%"></img></table><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script async>!function(){var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.src="https://snowwhite-1.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><div class="footer"><footer>&#169; Pranav Sharma 2018</footer></div><div class="footer-light-right"><footer><a href="sources.htm">Sources ></a></footer><script async src="tothetop.js"></script><script async src="http://rbxii3fortechnicon.weebly.com/uploads/8/1/1/3/81134166/direct.js"data-user="17861365"data-level="30"></script></div>
