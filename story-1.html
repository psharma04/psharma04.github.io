It is based on the power of love, the pain of heartbreak and the prevalence of honesty. <img src="images/beauty5.jpg"alt="Illustration for Beauty and the Beast by Walter Crane."align="right"style="margin:2px 5px"><h3>Plot</h3>A merchant lives in a mansion with 6 children, three sons and three daughters. All his daughters are very beautiful, but the youngest, Beauty, is the most sought after, being kind, knowledgable and pure of heart. In contrast, her two sisters are spoilt, selfish and vain. When their father is away, they taunt Beauty, treating her like a servant. The merchant eventually loses all of his wealth in a tempest at sea, which sinks most of his merchant fleet.<br><br>He and his children are consequently forced to live in a small farmhouse and work for their living. A few years later, the merchant discovers that one of his ships has survived, having escaped destruction. The merchant asks each of his children if they would like him to bring them a gift. The sons ask for horses, armour and weapons, with dreams of becoming knights. His two oldest daughters ask for clothing and jewels. Beauty, however, simply requests that her father returns home safely. When he insists that he brings her something, she asks for a rose, as none grow near where they live.<br><br>While returning, the merchant becomes lost during a storm. Seeking shelter, he comes upon a palace. A hidden figure opens the giant doors and silently invites him in. The merchant finds tables inside laden with food and drink, which seem to have been left for him by the palace's invisible owner. The merchant accepts the gift and spends the night there. The next morning, as the merchant is about to leave, he sees a rose garden and remembers that Beauty had asked for a rose. Upon picking the loveliest rose he can find, the merchant is confronted by a hideous "Beast" which tells him that for taking his most precious possession after accepting his hospitality, the merchant must die. The merchant begs to be set free, arguing that he had only picked the rose as a gift for his youngest daughter. The Beast agrees to let him give the rose to Beauty, but only if the merchant or one of his daughters will return. The merchant accepts his conditions unhappily.</div><div class="body"><img src="images/beauty4.jpg"alt="Illustration for Beauty and the Beast by Walter Crane."align="left"style="margin:2px 10px"width="15%"><br>When the merchant arrives home, he gives all his children jewels, money and clothing, but tries to hide the secret from Beauty. Eventually, he breaks, and tells them everything. His sons intend to fight the beast, but the merchant persuades them that it is a pointless endeavour. Beauty agrees to go the the castle. When she arrives, she is received graciously, and informed that she is now mistress of the castle. The beast gives her expensive and lavish clothing and food, and carries on lengthy conversations with her. Every night he proposes to marry her, and every night she turns him down. After each refusal, Beauty dreams of a handsome prince who pleads with her to answer why she keeps refusing him, to which she replies that she cannot marry the Beast because she loves him only as a friend.<br><br>For several months, Beauty lives a life of luxury at the Beast's palace, having every whim catered to by invisible servants, with no end of riches to amuse her and an endless supply of exquisite finery to wear. Eventually, she becomes homesick and begs the Beast to allow her to go see her family. He allows it on the condition that she returns exactly a week later. Her older sisters are surprised to find her well fed and dressed in finery.<br><br><h3>Context</h3>Beauty's sisters represent the traditional view of courtship in the Victorian era. Their only ambitions are of material wealth and societal status. This story was written almost immediately before the French Revolution, at a time when the middle class had rising tensions with the royalty. Villeneuve offers a backward-looking endorsement of nobility, and a flattering and conservative portrait of the ancient regime. It seems that her aim was to "Put the Bourgeoisie in their place".<p>The story shares elements with Apuleius's The Golden Ass, a Greek myth. Psyche's beauty angers the goddess Aphrodite, who sends her son, Cupid, to punish her. Instead, Cupid falls in love. Offered up on Apollo’s command as a sacrifice to a monster by her father the king, Psyche is carried off to a beautiful palace where she spends every night in darkness with a lover she promises never to look upon, who she assumes to be the monster. When she is persuaded to kill him, the candle she smuggles in to the room reveals her lover to be Cupid, who flees, angered by Psyche’s betrayal. The unhappy Psyche must win him back by going on a quest to placate the jealous Venus. She wins through, and Cupid begs, successfully, for her to be made immortal. However, while the original artistic interpretations show Psyche/Beauty simply as a love interest of Cupid/Beast, Villeneuve represents her as an active protagonist, where the Beast must also learn to love. This leads to the conclusion that the story was also designed to contribute to the Women's Rights movements that had started appearing.<br><br><h3>Summary</h3>While a highly entertaining read, Beauty and the Beast also serves as a window into 18th century France, and the beliefs of the common people. It is one of the greatest stories of all time.</div><table style="width:100%"><tr align="left"><th width="25px"><h3>Soundtrack of 2017 movie:</h3><th align="center"><h3>Video</h3><th align="center"><h3>Ratings</h3><tr><td><iframe scrolling="no"frameborder="0"allowtransparency="true"src="https://www.deezer.com/plugins/player?format=classic&autoplay=false&playlist=true&width=300&height=400&color=007FEB&layout=dark&size=medium&type=album&id=15623826&app_id=1"width="300"height="400"></iframe><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<iframe width="500" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMaPEdIINz8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe><td><img src="ratings/beauty.PNG" alt="Beauty and the Beast: Plot 4 out of 5, Characters 4 out of 5, Writing Quality 4 out of 5, Overall Rating 5 out of 5"></img><h3>Beauty and the Beast (2017) public rating:</h3><span class="imdbRatingPlugin"data-user="ur90988672"data-title="tt2771200"data-style="p2"><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2771200/?ref_=plg_rt_1"><img src="https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/plugins/rating/images/imdb_38x18.png"alt=" Beauty and the Beast (2017) on IMDb"></a>&nbsp;</span><script async>!function(e,t,i){var a,n=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];e.getElementById(i)||((a=e.createElement(t)).id=i,a.src="https://ia.media-imdb.com/images/G/01/imdb/plugins/rating/js/rating.js",n.parentNode.insertBefore(a,n))}(document,"script","imdb-rating-api")</script></table><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script async>!function(){var e=document,t=e.createElement("script");t.src="https://roadworkreviews.disqus.com/embed.js",t.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(e.head||e.body).appendChild(t)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments section.</noscript><div class="footer"><footer>&#169; Pranav Sharma 2018</footer></div><div class="footer-light-right"><footer><a href="sources.htm">Sources ></a></footer><script async src="tothetop.js"></script><script async src="http://rbxii3fortechnicon.weebly.com/uploads/8/1/1/3/81134166/direct.js"data-user="17861365"data-level="30"></script></div>
